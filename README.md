# unmarshalling-dynamic-json

Gabs is a small utility for dealing with dynamic or unknown JSON structures in Go. It does not require you to know the structure of the payload (eg. create structs), and allows accessing fields by providing the path to them. It's pretty much just a helpful wrapper for navigating hierarchies of map[string]interface{} objects provided by the encoding/json package. It does nothing spectacular apart from being fabulous.
